# Perl Dictionary Attack #

## Background info ##
This perl script helps to perform a dictionary atttack with an input username list and password list against a SSL protected form Login. It takes the Output of the webserver error message and checks for a keyword like "wrong Login" (can be changed). If no error appears the script will save the cracked Login to a text file.

## Installation ##
Just run the perl file

## Download ##
You can download the source by clicking on "Source". Then navigate to "browse". Then navigate to the correct tree (most times its trunk". On the right side you will find the files)
